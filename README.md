# Substitution Cipher

This project implements a **Substitution Cipher** algorithm that encrypts or decrypts text using a substitution key.
It reads an input file, applies the cipher operation, and generates an output file with the transformed text.

## Overview

A Substitution Cipher is a type of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.
This project allows for both encryption and decryption operations on text files.

## Features

- **Input File Handling**: The program reads plain text from an input file.
- **Cipher Operation**: Applies a Substitution Cipher to the text. You can define the substitution pattern (key) for encryption and decryption.
- **Output File**: Generates a new file with the encrypted or decrypted text based on the operation.

  ## Importance of the Project

In an increasingly digital world, encryption plays a crucial role in protecting sensitive information.
While modern encryption algorithms are more complex and secure, the **Substitution Cipher** serves as an essential educational tool for 
understanding the fundamental concepts of encryption, data security, and cryptography.

This project helps:

- **Understand the Basics of Cryptography**: Substitution Ciphers are one of the simplest forms of encryption.
- Working with them provides hands-on experience with the basic principles of cryptographic operations, helping learners
-  understand how text can be encrypted and decrypted using simple substitutions.

- **Learn About Data Integrity and Security**: Even though the Substitution Cipher is not secure by modern standards,
- it lays the groundwork for understanding how data can be protected through obfuscation.
- The project shows how information can be transformed and secured, even with simple techniques.

- **Practice Coding and Problem-Solving**: By implementing this cipher, you'll improve your coding skills and gain experience in essential
-  programming concepts such as file I/O (input/output), string manipulation, and algorithm implementation in Python. 
-  This project is a great exercise in logic and algorithm design, making it a useful learning tool for both beginners and intermediate programmers.
